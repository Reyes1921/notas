# `Rollup`

Rollup is a JavaScript module bundler that allows you to compile small pieces of code into more complex applications or libraries . It is similar to other bundlers like Webpack and Browserify, but aims to be more efficient and lightweight.

Rollup works by analyzing your code and outputting a smaller bundle that only includes the pieces of your code that are actually used. This can lead to faster load times and better performance for your applications.

Rollup is highly configurable and supports a variety of different module formats, including CommonJS, AMD, ES2015 modules, and more. It also has a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality and customize the way your code is bundled.

Overall, Rollup is a useful tool for any JavaScript developer looking to create efficient, high-performance applications or libraries.
