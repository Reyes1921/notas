# `pnpm`

PNPM is an alternative package manager for Node.js which stands for “Performant NPM”.

The main purpose of PNPM is to hold all the packages at a global (centralized) store and use them if needed by other projects too by creating hard links to it.

Advantages of using PNPM over NPM
 - Saves a huge amount of disk space.
 - Takes faster time to install the packages.
 - It has in-built support for mono repositories.
