# `Shadcn UI`

Shadcn is an open-source framework providing pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI components for rapid web application development. It offers a streamlined approach to construct modern user interfaces.

This is NOT a `component library`. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.

What do you mean by not a `component library`?

I mean you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm.

Pick the components you need. Copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
