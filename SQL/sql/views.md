# `Views`

Views in SQL are virtual tables based on the result set of an SQL statement. They act as a saved query that can be treated like a table, offering several benefits:

- Simplifying complex queries by encapsulating joins and subqueries
- Providing an additional security layer by restricting access to underlying tables
- Presenting data in a more relevant format for specific users or applications

Views can be simple (based on a single table) or complex (involving multiple tables, subqueries, or functions). Some databases support updatable views, allowing modifications to the underlying data through the view. Materialized views, available in some systems, store the query results, improving performance for frequently accessed data at the cost of additional storage and maintenance overhead.

# `Creating Views`

Creating views in SQL involves using the `CREATE VIEW` statement to define a virtual table based on the result of a `SELECT` query. Views don't store data themselves but provide a way to present data from one or more tables in a specific format. They can simplify complex queries, enhance data security by restricting access to underlying tables, and provide a consistent interface for querying frequently used data combinations. Views can be queried like regular tables and are often used to encapsulate business logic or present data in a more user-friendly manner.

# `Modifying Views`

In SQL, you can modify a VIEW in two ways:

- Using `CREATE` OR `REPLACE VIEW`: This command helps you modify a `VIEW` but keeps the `VIEW` name intact. This is beneficial when you want to change the definition of the `VIEW` but do not want to change the `VIEW` name.

- Using the `DROP VIEW` and then `CREATE VIEW`: In this method, you first remove the `VIEW` using the `DROP VIEW` command and then recreate the view using the new definition with the `CREATE VIEW` command.
