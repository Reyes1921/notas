# `Apis and integrations`

- `gPRC`

  `gRPC` is a platform agnostic serialization protocol that is used to communicate between services. Designed by Google in 2015, it is a modern alternative to REST APIs. It is a binary protocol that uses HTTP/2 as a transport layer. It is a high performance, open source, general-purpose RPC framework that puts mobile and HTTP/2 first.

- `Esb soap`

- `GraphQL`

  GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.

- `REST`

  REST, or REpresentational State Transfer, is an architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate with each other.

- `BPM BPEL`

  `BPM: Business Process Management`
  Medium or large enterprises needs robust processes to streamline their business needs by reducing the cost incurred per process and diminishing the turn around time for each activity. To achieve the above, there are various BPM tools like PEGA, IBM BPM, Appian, etc. Basically these tools automate the processes through a robust process modelling and implementation.

  `BPMN: Business Process Management Notations`
  Its is a standard for representing business processes graphically. While modelling the process, the notations used are complied with BPMN (there are other like EPC, etc.). So BPMN is a standard notation that BPM consultants follow to model the business process. BPMN has versions and now BPMN 2.0 is the standard one.

  `BPEL : Business Process Execution Language`
  Programmers use BPEL to define how a business process that involves web services will be executed. BPEL messages are typically used to invoke remote services, orchestrate process execution and manage events and exceptions. BPEL is often associated with Business Process Management Notation. In many organizations, analysts use BPMN to visualize business processes and developers transform the visualizations to BPEL for execution.

- `Messaging queues`

  Message queuing makes it possible for applications to communicate asynchronously, by sending messages to each other via a queue. A message queue provides temporary storage between the sender and the receiver so that the sender can keep operating without interruption when the destination program is busy or not connected.
