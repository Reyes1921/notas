# `Important Skills`

To support the laid-out activities specific skills are required. From my experience, read books and discussions we can boil this down to these ten skills every software architect should have:

# `Design and Architecture`

What makes a good design? This is probably the most important and challenging question. I will make a distinction between theory and practice. To my experience, having a mix of both is most valuable.

- Know the basic design patterns
- Dig deeper into patterns and anti-patterns
- Know quality measures
- Try out and understand different technology stacks
- Analyze and understand applied patterns

# `Decision Making`

An architect needs to be able to take decisions and guide projects or the entire organization into the right direction.

- Know what is important
- Prioritize
- Know your competence
- Evaluate multiple options

# `Simplifying Things`

Keep in mind the problem-solving principle Occam’s Razor which states to prefer simplicity. I interpret the principle as following: If you have too many assumptions about the problem to solve your solution will probably be wrong or lead to an unnecessary complex solution. Assumptions should be reduced (simplified) to come to a good solution.

- Shake the solution
- Take a step back
- Divide and Conquer
- Refactoring is not evil

# `How to Code`

Even as an Enterprise Architect, the most abstract level of architecture, you should still know what developers are doing on their daily basis. And if you do not understand how this is done, you may face two major problems:

- Developers won’t accept your sayings.
- You do not understand challenges and needs of developers.
- Have a side project
- Find the right things to try out

# `Documentation`

Architectural documentation is sometimes more and sometimes less important. Important documents are for example architectural decisions or code guidelines. Initial documentation is often required before coding starts and need to be refined continuously. Other documentation can be automatically generated as code can also be documentation, e.g. UML class diagrams.

- Clean Code
- Generate documentation where possible
- As much as necessary, as little as possible
- Learn more about architecture framework

# `Communication`

From my observations this is one of the most underestimated skill. If you are brilliant in design but cannot communicate your ideas, your thoughts are likely to have less impact or even fail to succeed.

- Learn how to communicate your ideas
- Give talks to large groups
- Find the right level of communication
- Communicate often
- Be transparent
- Be always prepared to give a presentation

# `Estimate and Evaluate`

- Know basic project management principles
- Evaluate “unknown” architecture

# `Balance`

- Quality comes at a price
- Solve contradicting goals
- Conflict management

# `Consult and Coach`

Being pro-active is probably the best you can do when it comes to consulting and coaching. If you are asked, it is often too late. And cleaning up on the architecture site is something which you want to avoid. You need to somehow foresee the next weeks, months or even years and prepare yourself and the organization for the next steps.

- Have a vision
- Build a community of practice (CoP)
- Conduct open door sessions

# `Marketing Skills`

Your ideas are great and you have communicated them well but still nobody wants to follow? Then you probably lack marketing skills.

- Motivate and convince
- Fight for your ideas and be persistent
- Find allies
- Repeat It, Believe It
