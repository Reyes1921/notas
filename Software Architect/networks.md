# `OSI and TCP/IP Models`

The OSI and TCP/IP model is used to help the developer to design their system for interoperability. The OSI model has 7 layers while the TCP/IP model has a more summarized form of the OSI model only consisting 4 layers. This is important if you’re are trying to design a system to communicate with other systems.

# `Http Https`

HTTP is the TCP/IP based application layer communication protocol which standardizes how the client and server communicate with each other. It defines how the content is requested and transmitted across the internet.

HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website.

# `Proxies`

In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

# `Firewalls`

A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on an organization’s previously established security policies.

## `Observación`

Se utiliza un firewall para definir el perímetro de la red e identificar y bloquear el tráfico potencialmente sospechoso y malicioso. Por otro lado, un proxy ayuda a proteger la privacidad y puede ayudar a hacer cumplir las políticas corporativas con respecto a la navegación por Internet.
