# `Infrastructure as Code`

Sometimes referred to as IaC, this section refers to the techniques and tools used to define infrastructure, typically in a markup language like YAML or JSON. Infrastructure as code allows DevOps Engineers to use the same workflows used by software developers to version, roll back, and otherwise manage changes.

The term Infrastructure as Code encompasses everything from bootstrapping to configuration to orchestration, and it is considered a best practice in the industry to manage all infrastructure as code. This technique precipitated the explosion in system complexity seen in modern DevOps organizations.

# `Cloud providers`

# `Serverless Concepts`

Serverless is a cloud-native development model that allows developers to build and run applications without having to manage servers.

There are still servers in serverless, but they are abstracted away from app development. A cloud provider handles the routine work of provisioning, maintaining, and scaling the server infrastructure. Developers can simply package their code in containers for deployment.

# `Linux / Unix`

Knowledge of UNIX is a must for almost all kind of development as most of the codes that you write is most likely going to be finally deployed on a UNIX/Linux machine. Linux has been the backbone of the free and open source software movement, providing a simple and elegant operating system for almost all your needs.

# `Service Mesh`

A Service Mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. It’s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application. In layman’s terms, it’s a tool which helps you to control how different services communicate with each other.

# `CI / CD`

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are `continuous integration, continuous delivery`, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams (AKA “integration hell”).

# `Containers`

Containers are a construct in which cgroups, namespaces, and chroot are used to fully encapsulate and isolate a process. This encapsulated process, called a container image, shares the kernel of the host with other containers, allowing containers to be significantly smaller and faster than virtual machines.

These images are designed for portability, allowing for full local testing of a static image, and easy deployment to a container management platform.

# `Cloud Design Patterns`

These design patterns are useful for building reliable, scalable, secure applications in the cloud.

The link below has cloud design patterns where each pattern describes the problem that the pattern addresses, considerations for applying the pattern, and an example based on Microsoft Azure. Most patterns include code samples or snippets that show how to implement the pattern on Azure. However, most patterns are relevant to any distributed system, whether hosted on Azure or other cloud platforms.
