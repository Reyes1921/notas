# `Patterns and design principles`

- OOP
- CQRS (Segregation of Responsibility for Command Queries)
- ACID & CAP Theorem

  ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) and CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance) are essential concepts in distributed systems. They are often used to explain the trade-offs between consistency and availability.

  CAP is an acronym for Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance. According to the CAP theorem, any distributed system can only guarantee two of the three properties at any time. You can’t guarantee all three properties at once.

  ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. ACID is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee validity even in the event of errors, power failures, etc.

- Test Driven Development
- MVC MVP MVVM
- Actors
  Actor Model is a model that represents actors as the basic unit of a system, they can only communicate through messages and have their own private state, and they can also manage other actors, resulting in an encapsulated and fault-tolerant system.
