# `What is Software Architecture?`

Describes how an application is built including its components, how they interact with each other, environment in which they operate and so on.

# `What is Software Architect?`

An expert developer who design software solutions from the ground up, making high-level decisions about each stage of the process including technical standards, tools, design principles, platforms to be used, etc., leading a team of engineers to create the final product.

# `Levels of Architecture`

Architecture can be done on several “levels” of abstractions. The level influences the importance of necessary skills. As there are many categorizations possible my favorite segmentation includes these 3 levels:

- `Application Level`: The lowest level of architecture. Focus on one single application. Very detailed, low level design. Communication is usually within one development team.
- `Solution Level`: The mid-level of architecture. Focus on one or more applications which fulfill a business need (business solution). Some high, but mainly low-level design. Communication is between multiple development teams.
- `Enterprise Level`: The highest level of architecture. Focus on multiple solutions. High level, abstract design, which needs to be detailed out by solution or application architects. Communication is across the organization.
