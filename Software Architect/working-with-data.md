## `Apache spark`

Apache Spark is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

## `Hadoop`

The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.

## `Datawarehouses principles`

It is based on the assumption that every system should take care of a concern in a way that such concern should be encapsulated by the system itself.

# `Spark, Hadoop MapReduce`

`Apache Spark` is a data processing framework that can quickly perform processing tasks on very large data sets, and can also distribute data processing tasks across multiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other distributed computing tools.

`Hadoop MapReduce` is a software framework for easily writing applications which process vast amounts of data (multi-terabyte data-sets) in-parallel on large clusters (thousands of nodes) of commodity hardware in a reliable, fault-tolerant manner.

# `ETL Datawarehouses`

In the world of data warehousing, if you need to bring data from multiple different data sources into one, centralized database, you must first:

- `EXTRACT` data from its original source
- `TRANSFORM` data by deduplicating it, combining it, and ensuring quality, to then
- `LOAD` data into the target database

ETL tools enable data integration strategies by allowing companies to gather data from multiple data sources and consolidate it into a single, centralized location. ETL tools also make it possible for different types of data to work together.

# `Sql databases`

SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s used for relational databases. A SQL database is a collection of tables that stores a specific set of structured data.

# `Nosql databases`

NoSQL databases (aka “not only SQL”) are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.

Types of NoSQL databases

- Document databases Ex. MongoDB
- Key-value databases Ex. Redis
- Wide-column databases Ex. Cassandra
- Graph databases Ex. Neo4J
