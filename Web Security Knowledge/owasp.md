# `OWASP Security Risks`

``OWASP`` (Open Web Application Security Project) is a nonprofit foundation focused on improving software security. One of the most well-known resources created by ``OWASP`` is the ``OWASP`` Top Ten, a regularly updated list of the most critical web application security risks . The current version is the ``OWASP`` Top Ten 2021. The top ten risks are:

- Injection
- Broken Authentication
- Sensitive Data Exposure
- XML External Entities (XXE) 5 . Broken Access Control
- Security Misconfiguration
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Deserialization
- Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

It's worth noting that while this list is a useful resource for prioritizing security efforts, it should be seen as a starting point rather than a comprehensive guide. Organizations should take a holistic approach to security, focusing on prevention, detection, and response to a broad range of threats.
