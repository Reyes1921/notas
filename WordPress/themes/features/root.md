# `Block Stylesheets`

When styling blocks, you should always do so via the theme.json styles property if possible. This ensures that your styles have the best compatibility across the system, working alongside the default WordPress styles, those added by plugins, and user customizations.

# `Block Variations`

The Block Variations API is a powerful feature that allows you to extend any registered blocks. Basically, it gives you the ability to create alternate versions of a block’s settings. This can make it easier for your users to insert blocks without the hassle of going through all of the setup they might need for a specific scenario.
