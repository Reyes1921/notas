# `What is functions.php?`

The `functions.php` essentially acts like a WordPress plugin, letting you add custom PHP functions, classes, interfaces, and more. It opens up the entirety of the PHP programming language to your theme.

WordPress automatically loads the `functions.php` file (if it exists) as soon as it loads the theme on all page views on both the admin and front-end of the website. So it provides you with a lot of power to build unique features around WordPress.
