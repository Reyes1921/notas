# `Navigation Basics`

In Linux, navigation between directories and files is a fundamental, yet essential function that allows you to exploit the power of the command-line interface (CLI). Mastering the basic Linux navigation commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, and `tree` enables you to flawlessly move from one point to another within the filesystem, display the list of files & directories, and understand your position relative to other system components.

# `Linux Navigation Basics: Basic Commands`

Linux Navigation Basics is about using simple commands to move around and manage files on your computer. For example, `cd` lets you go into different folders, `ls` shows you what files and folders are inside, and `pwd` tells you where you are currently. These commands help you easily find and organize your files.

# `Moving Files and Directories`

The `mv` command moves files and directories between locations and can also rename them. Use syntax `mv [options] source destination` where source is the file/directory to move and destination is the target location. This versatile command is essential for file organization and management in Linux systems.

# `Creating and Deleting Files`

Linux file operations include creating files with `touch` (empty files) or `cat > filename` (with content) and deleting with `rm filename`. Use `rm -i` for confirmation prompts and `rmdir` for empty directories. File deletion is permanent - no recycle bin. Essential commands for basic file management and system administration.

# `Understanding Directory Hierarchy`

In Linux, understanding the directory hierarchy is crucial for efficient navigation and file management. A Linux system's directory structure, also known as the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), is a defined tree structure that helps to prevent files from being scattered all over the system and instead organise them in a logical and easy-to-navigate manner.

- `/`: Root directory, the top level of the file system.
- `/home`: User home directories.
- `/bin`: Essential binary executables.
- `/sbin`: System administration binaries.
- `/etc`: Configuration files.
- `/var`: Variable data (logs, spool files).
- `/usr`: User programs and data.
- `/lib`: Shared libraries.
- `/tmp`: Temporary files.
- `/opt`: Third-party applications.
