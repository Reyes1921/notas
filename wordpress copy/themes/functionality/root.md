# `404 Pages`

A 404 page is important to add into your theme in case a user stumbles upon a page that doesn’t exist or hasn’t been created yet. It is also important that your 404 page gives your visitors a way to arrive at the right place.

## `Creating the 404.php file`

As the `404.php` file is used on a page not found error, the first step is to create a file named `404.php` and add it to your WordPress theme folder.
