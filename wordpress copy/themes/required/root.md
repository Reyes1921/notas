# `Required Files`

# `Classic Theme`

The only files needed for a WordPress theme to work out of the box are an `index.php` file to display your list of posts and a `style.css` file to style the content.

# `Block Themes`

There are two necessary files for WordPress to recognize your block theme, and you will learn more about these in the coming documentation:

- `style.css` (Main Stylesheet): This file is required for configuring theme data, such as its name and description. It can also be used for adding custom CSS.

- `templates/index.html (Templates)`: The default/fallback template. This is necessary for WordPress to consider this a block theme.
