# `Theme`

A WordPress theme represents the design of your website. It can control everything from `colors`, to `fonts`, to the `entire layout`. In essence, what you see when viewing the front-end of your site is shaped by the theme.

As a theme creator, you can:

- Create different layouts, such as one, two or more columns.
- Control the typography of the site with custom font choices.
- Skin the site with any color scheme you want.
- Put a sidebar on the left or right side of the page. Or, have no sidebar at all.
- Display featured images alongside posts.

## `Block themes`

A `block theme` is a new theme that you can use from WordPress version 5.9. It is built mainly using HTML and a theme configuration file. The block theme is composed entirely of blocks, allowing you to edit all parts of your site in the Site Editor.

Block themes are the modern method of building WordPress themes. They generally follow a standard set of conventions and are built entirely out of blocks. This handbook will primarily focus on building themes using this method because it is the future of the WordPress project.

## `Classic themes`

A `classic theme` is the original theme, without version limitations, that primarily uses PHP, JavaScript and CSS. Classic themes take advantage of WordPress PHP functions, `hooks` and `filters`.

Classic themes use a PHP-based templating system, which is still supported in WordPress today. They are still in wide use because they were built on the theming system that was first introduced in 2005 with the launch of WordPress 1.5. There is a long and deep history of classic theming in WordPress, which continues on. For this reason, the handbook maintains documentation for classic themes in the Classic Themes chapter.

## `Hybrid themes`

`Hybrid themes are merely classic themes` that have adopted some modern block-related features, such as global settings and styles or block template parts. This is a widely agreed-upon term by the community, but it is not an “official” theme type. At the end of the day, hybrids are still classic themes.
